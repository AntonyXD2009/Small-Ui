# Welcome to Small Ui Project ðŸ‘‹
- **Small Ui** Is designed to reduce the number of elements that appear on the screen for better viewing and performance on all devices.

## Information
- Some elements cannot be viewed due to reduced performance on some low-resource devices.

- **We do not promise to completely improve game performance** as it may vary depending on your device.

## Pack Settings
- If after having installed the package and you need to adjust or display some complete settings, we will add the subpackages option to be able to apply certain options for display.

- Before using, **remember that you cannot steal my code or go through the official creator of my project**, otherwise I can file a **complaint claiming copyright or deletion of the video!**
